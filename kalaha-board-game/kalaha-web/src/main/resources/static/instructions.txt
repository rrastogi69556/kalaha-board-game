Each of the two players has their six pits in front of him. Top-side player has a large pit on left side, bottom-side player
has a larger pit on the right side. At the start of the game, there are stones in each of the round pits.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Rules Game Play</b>
<br/>
The player who begins with the first move picks up all the stones in any of his own pits, and
sows the stones on to the right(anticlockwise), one in each of the following pits, including his own big pit. No
stones are put in the opponents' big pit. If the player's last stone lands in his own big pit, he
gets another turn. This can be repeated several times before it's the other player's turn.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Capturing Stones</b>
<br/>
During the game the pits are emptied on both sides. Always when the last stone lands in an own
empty pit, the player captures his own stone and all stones in the opposite pit (the other playerâ€™s
pit) and puts them in his own (big or little?) pit.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>The Game Ends</b>
<br/>
The game is over as soon as one of the sides runs out of stones. The player who still has stones in
his pits keeps them and puts them in his big pit. The winner of the game is the player who has the
most stones in his big pit.
